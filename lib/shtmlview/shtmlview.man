[description]

The [package shtmlview::shtmlview] package provides the shtmlview::shtmlview
widget which is a standard tk text widget with support for rendering a
reasonable subset of html tags and, if the tcllib library Markdown is
available, as well for Markdown files. It is a pure Tcl/Tk widget which does
not need any compilation.

[para]
The widget is not(!) to be intended to be used as a web browser. It only supports relative links on a local filesystem, it does not(!) support style sheets, it does not support any http(s) or webserver like links or images. 
It is tought as a fallback widget in cases where no other possibilities exists to
display HTML or Markdown markup inside a Tk application. So it can be
used in cases where the developer has control over the used subset of HTML
markup or as a fallback mechanism where no other possibilities exists to
display HTML or Markdown documents. 

[para]

The widget is intended to be used for instance as a help viewer
or in other cases where the developer has control about the used html tags.
Comments and feedbacks are welcome. The [cmd shtmlview::shtmlview] widget overloads the text 
widget and provides new commands, named [method back], [method browse],
[method dosearch], [method forward], [method home], [method open], [method reload],
[method url] and new options, named [option -browsecmd], [option -home], [option -tablesupport], 
[option -toolbar]. 

[para]

Furthermore the file shtmlview.tcl can be used as standalone application to
render Markdown and HTML files by executing [cmd "shtmlview.tcl filename"] in
the terminal.

[para]

The [cmd ::shtmlview::shtmlview] command creates creates a new window (given
by the pathName argument) and makes it into [cmd ::shtmlview::shtmlview]
widget. The [package ::shtmlview::shtmlview] command returns its pathName
argument. At the time this command is invoked, there must not exist a window
named pathName, but pathName's parent must exist. The API described in this document is not the whole
API offered by the snit object [cmd ::shtmlview::shtmlview].
Instead, it is the subset of that API that is expected not to change in future versions. 


[para]

Background: [cmd ::shtmlview::shtmlview] is a pure Tcl/Tk widget based on the
library htmllib developed in the 90ties by Stephen Uhler and Clif Flynt. This
library was wrapped into the excellent mega-widget framework snit by Robert
Heller in 2009. His widget however was tied directly into a help system. The
author of this document just isolated the display part and added some
functions such as changing font size and a few buttons in the toolbar. Also a
rudimentary display of data tables was added. Later as well support for inline
images and extended keybindings and Markdown support was added.

[para]


[section INSTALLATION]

The widget requires the tcllib [cmd snit] package and optional, if desired to display Markdown files, the tcllib [cmd Markdown] library.
The [cmd shtmlview::shtmlview] package is delivered as a normal Tcl package
folder which can be placed anywhere on your file system or in a folder
belonging to your Tcl library path. In case you installed it into a non-standard folder
just use append your [cmd auto_path] variable as shown below:

[example {
lappend auto_path /path/to/parent-folder ;# of shtmlview folder
package require shtmlview::shtmlview
}]

Alternatively you can directly source the file shtmlview.tcl into your Tcl application.

[section COMMANDS]

[list_begin definitions]

[call [cmd ::shtmlview::shtmlview] [arg pathName] [opt [arg options]]]

Creates and configures a shtmlview widget.

[list_end]

[section {WIDGET OPTIONS}]

[para]

To configure the internal text widget the helptext command courld be used directly.

[list_begin options]

[opt_def -browsecmd cmd]

Each time a HTML or Markdown page is rendered the given [option -browsecmd] is invoked. The actual URL is appended as first argument to the command.

[opt_def -closebutton boolean]

Should the close button in the toolbar been shown, useful if your widget is embedded in a toplevel, default: true

[opt_def -historycombo boolean]

If true (default is false) displays a ttk::combobox if the tile package is available in the toolbar.
Can be only set a widget creation.

[opt_def -home string]

Set's the homepage filename of the shtmlview widget. If not set, the first page browsed
will be automatically set as the home page.

[opt_def -tablesupport boolean]

If true (default) the widget will provide some table support. This will have
some undesired results if table tags are misused as markup tool. Simple html
tables with th and td tags should display however well if no internal markup
inside those tags is implemented.

[opt_def -toolbar boolean]

If true (default) a toolbar will be displayed on top providing standard buttons for
methods [method back], [method forward] and [method home] as well as search
facilities for the widget. Default: true

[list_end]

[section {WIDGET COMMANDS}]

Each shtmlview widget created with the above command supports the following
commands and options:

[list_begin definitions]

[call [arg pathName] [method back]]

Displays the previous HTML and Markdown page in the browsing history if any.

[call [arg pathName] [method browse] [arg filename] [opt args]]

Displays the HTML or Markdown page given by filename(s). 
The first given filename will be shown in the widget, the other, 
optional given filenames will be added to the history stack only and can be walked using the history keys, f and b.

[call [arg pathName] [method dosearch] [arg string] [arg direction]]

Search and hilights the given string from the current index either
in the given direction either forward (default) or backwards.

[call [arg pathName] [method forward]]

Displays the next HTML or Markdown page in the browsing history if any.

[call [arg pathName] [method getFiles]]

This command returns a list of all visited files, cleaned up for multiple entries and without anchor links.

[call [arg pathName] [method getHistory]]

This command returns a list of the current history of visited files and anchors.

[call [arg pathName] [method getTextWidget]]

This commands returns the internal pathname of the text widget. The developer
can that way thereafter deal directly with the internal text widget if
required. Alternatively the [method helptext] command can be used. See below.

[call [arg pathName] [method helptext] [arg cmd] [opt [arg options]]]

This command exposes the internal text widget. See the following example:

[example {
    ::shtmlview::shtmlview .help 
    .help browse index.html
    .help helptext configure -background yellow
}]


[call [arg pathName] [method home]]

Displays the first HTML or Markdown page which was called by [arg pathName] [method browse] or set by [option -home].

[call [arg pathName] [method open]]

Displays a standard file dialog to open a HTML or Markdown page to be displayed in the [cmd shtmlview::shtmlview] widget.

[call [arg pathName] [method reload]]

Reloads and redisplays the current HTML or Markdown page visible inside the [cmd shtmlview::shtmlview] widget.

[call [arg pathName] [method url]]

Returns the current URL displayed in the [cmd ::shtmlview::shtmlview] widget.

[list_end]

[section "BINDINGS FOR THE WIDGET"]

The widget contain standard navigation key bindings to browse the content of
an HTML or Markdown page. Furthermore the keypress s and r are bound to the start of
forward and reverse searches in the content. The keys 'n' (next) and 'p' (previous) are used to repeat the current search.
The keys 'f' and 'b' keys are bound to browsing forward and backward in the browse history. The 'q' key deletes the current file from the history and displays the next one.
The 'TAB' key browses to the next hyperlink, and pressing the Return/Enter key process the current link. The key combination 'Ctrl-r' reloads the current page.

[section EXAMPLE]
[example {
    package require Tk
    package require snit
    package require shtmlview::shtmlview
    proc browsed {url} {
        puts "You browsed $url"
    }
    set help [::shtmlview::shtmlview .help -toolbar true \
        -browsecmd browsed]
    $help browse index.html
    pack $help -fill both -expand true -side left
    package require Markdown
    $help browser test.md
}]

Further examples are in the source package for [package shtmlview::shtmlview].
